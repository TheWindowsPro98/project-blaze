Build 20221025
	(First Release)
	-Adds controllable player sprite (via </> DPAD buttons)
	-...and a marvelous background

Build 20221104
	-Same as previous build (except the background scrolls)

Build 20221119
	-Removes everything in the previous builds except their assets
	-Adds all PCM assets into the game (but unused)
	-Adds a SEGA screen (then nothing else)

Build 20221120
	-SEGA screen now goes to a title screen
	-Pressing START cuts to black
	-"PRESS START" text fades in and out
	-Uppercase letters, numbers, etc are edited (not lowercase)

Build 20221121
	-Adds in VGM assets (once again, unused)
	-Removes the fades from the "PRESS START" title screen text
	-Adds a main menu screen with a very bad placeholder background
	-All options (when start is pressed) simply clear Background A's data (options are still selectable afterwards, text just doesn't render)

Build 20221122
	-Swaps the XGM audio driver with a different PCM driver for the menus since 4 channels are not needed yet (hell, 4 channels aren't needed, period.)
	-Adds "Continue Game" option to the main menu (still does nothing)
	-Swaps the previous options background with an even worse, WIP background (which would later be sent to hell where it belongs)

Build 20221214
	-Finally got my shit together when it comes to versioning things
	-Started development on a save feature
	-Changed font slightly
	-Added lowercase letters to the font (they kinda look goofy)
	-Changed options background to a passable (probably still placeholder) one

Build 20221217
	-SRAM works
	-New/Continue Game do things
		-New Game - Write default values to SRAM byte offset $0000 to $0008 (Fusion writes $FF every other byte, padding the file from 32K to 64K, i gots no idea why), then fade to black (after a while you are still able to select other options)
		-Continue Game - read values from SRAM byte offset $0000 to $0008, then fade to black, other options still selectable afterwards
	-Options menu added
		-Can change difficulty
		-Can NOT select SFX/Music Boxes
		-Can exit the options menu (very important)

Build 20221220
	-Options changed to Preferences (still the same menu)
	-SFX/Music Boxes selectable
		-Music Box - Plays all VGM tracks
		-SFX Box - Plays all PCM tracks
		-Both can be exited with the B button (also important)
		-NOTE: Most VGM/SFX are placeholders at this point and are subject to change
		-NOTE: PSG is an ass in this build and won't stop even if you tell it to
